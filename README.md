# Godot-SignalR
A **WIP** SignalR adaptation for godot, using GdExtension
> Uses [microsoft-signalr](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR-Client-Cpp/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#command-line-build) and all of its dependencies

> Currently there is no precompiled version, you need to compile it yourself

Created to allow for pubsubconnectionhandles in godot-playfab

### 🕹️ Usage
```GDScript
# To create a connection, you first need a signal_r node refrence
var node = $Signal_R
# For a connection you need the url and http_headers (they can be left blank if not needed)
node.build("http://localhost:5000", "")
# Now get the handle (unfinished)
var handle : String = node.get_handle()
# (todo documentation)
```

### ✅ Functionality
- **Connect to a signalr server** (Note: Not fully tested, and may not work at all on diffrent operating systems)
- **Disconnect to a signalr server** (Note: ^^^)
- **Listening to messages inside godot** (Note: Currently only strings)
- **Uses async/threading to prevent freezing**
### ❌ To be added
- **Add signalr::signalr_client_config to be able to add html-headers** (Note: Features draft)
- **Add functions to manage the connection in godot**

### 📌 Guide to developing this addon
1. Clone Repo
2. Run ```git submodule update --init``` to get godot-cpp
3. Install vpckg in this directory
4. Install [microsoft-signalr](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR-Client-Cpp/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#command-line-build) using vpckg and all its dependencies
> Make sure you match the structure provided in **sconstruct** (Note: The dependencies of microsoft-signalr should be installed automatically)
5. Done, you should now be able to develop the addon!
